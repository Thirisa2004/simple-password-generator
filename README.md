In the digital age where security breaches are prevalent, the need for robust password management is paramount. This project aims to develop a simple password generator application to address this pressing concern. The application will offer users a convenient solution for generating strong and unique passwords tailored to their specific requirements.

The key features of the password generator will include customizable parameters such as password length, character types (e.g., uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols), and any additional user-defined preferences. By allowing users to specify their criteria, the application ensures that generated passwords meet both security standards and individual preferences.

The simplicity and ease of use of the password generator will be emphasized throughout the development process. The user interface will be designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, enabling users of all levels of technical proficiency to generate passwords effortlessly.

Security will be a primary focus of the application, with measures implemented to ensure that generated passwords are strong and resistant to common password attacks. Additionally, the application will not store any generated passwords, prioritizing user privacy and security.

Overall, the simple password generator project aims to provide users with a reliable tool for enhancing their online security by generating strong and unique passwords tailored to their preferences, thereby mitigating the risks associated with weak or reused passwords.
